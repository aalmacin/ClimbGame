# Gameplay Mechanics

##Overview
There are ropes all over the place from which the character climbs up on. The player either swipes up, down, left, or right to move the character from one rope to another, or to move up and down from the same rope. The character only moves on the ropes.

Objects will randomly arrive from all sides of the screen (left, right, up, down). When an object makes contact with the player. The player will automatically lose the game. Therefore, the player must dodge the incoming objects to survive.

Shadows appear on the screen to indicate the location of the object. This gives the player time to decide which way to move, to dodge the object. 

Some ropes are defective which means that once the player jumps on them, they might snap within a few seconds that the player is hanging on it. 

The controls are super responsive. This means that if the player swipes towards a location where there are no ropes present, the character will still jump on to that location and since there are no ropes present, the player will fall and lose the game.

The game goes on forever, and the player receives points based on how far they make it up the “Mysterious Cliff of Tababi”. The game starts off simple with only a few objects arriving in. The game becomes more challenging with multiple objects coming in from all directions, affecting more than one rope at the same time. The game continues to become more challenging up to a point where the player must rely on consistency to achieve a high score.

The player has the freedom to move all around the game as long as they are touching the rope.

## Mechanics
